## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media Queries


### What I learned

I used media queries to make QR code responsivei didn't learn somthing new in this applcation but i will keep example below to note forget how to write them  

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
